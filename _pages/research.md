<h1> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Children's comprehension of disjunction </span> </h1> 

For my _Ph.D._ _dissertation_, I am looking into Bengali children's comprehension of the disjunction word _or_. My work is informed by the current literature on children's pragmatic acquisition, especially their acquisition of scalar implicature. <!--, and is influenced by the ideas of the Relevance Theory (Sperber & Wilson, 1986/1995)--> My research questions are whether preschool children can derive scalar implicature from disjunctive sentences and what is the reason behind their apparent pragmatic difficulty. <!--To answer these questions, I am using experimental methods that are geared toward bringing maximum relevance to the children in the studies. My work also incorporates knowledge from the research done on the Theory of Mind.-->

Below, I have added a list of references to give you a preliminary idea about the nature and scope of my work:

<h1> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Processing scalar implicature </span> </h1> 
In this project, I am exploring adults' processing of scalar implicature. My interest is to test whether implicature derivation is cognitively costly. I hypothesize that the processing effort required to compute scalar implicature is the same as the computation of logical meaning.

It is because both lower-bounded (logical) meaning and upper-bounded (implicature) meaning are not removed from context, and contextual information is not necessarily actively sought by the listener; rather it is given as the listener's cognitive environment. Please have a look at the following list to get an idea of the scope of the research.

<h1> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Disjunction expressions in Indian languages: Usage of conditional morphemes </span> </h1>
This project aims to capture the nature of disjunction words used in the languages of the Indian sub-continent. Indian languages like Hindi or Bengali use more than one expression to refer to disjunction in sentences. 
<!--more-->
For example, Hindi uses '_yā_' and '_nahito_'; Bengali uses '_bā_ ' and '_noyto_' to refer to disjunction. Interestingly, words like '_nahito_' and '_noyto_' are bi-morphemic which can be split into an 'if not' construction. This phenomenon is not noticed in languages such as English, Japanese, Mandarin, or French for instance. Such bi-morphemic disjunction expressions are seen in other Indian languages too. Such as Meitei, a north-east Indian language, uses the word '_natraga_' or '_natradi_' to refer to disjunction which too have the 'if-not' meaning. For example, '_natra_' means 'not' and '_ga_' is a conditional bound morpheme. 

I aim to investigate why there is more than one expression for simple disjunction in these languages and how they are used - especially what significance the 'if-not' construction holds in these languages. My greater objective is to see how the information can feed/counter the existing theories about the human language faculty.
