<h1> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Children's comprehension of disjunction </span> </h1> 

For my _Ph.D._ _dissertation_, I investigated the comprehension of the disjunction word or in Bengali-speaking children. This research is situated within the broader field of pragmatic development, with a particular focus on how children acquire scalar implicatures, i.e., context-dependent inferences that go beyond the literal meaning of sentences.   

My primary research questions were twofold: first, whether preschool-aged children can reliably derive scalar implicatures from disjunctive sentences (e.g., understanding that “A or B” can imply “not both A and B” in certain contexts); and second, what cognitive or linguistic factors underlie their apparent difficulty with these pragmatic inferences.

To address these questions, I employed experimental methods designed to probe children’s interpretations of disjunctive sentences in controlled contexts, allowing for a careful distinction between literal understanding and pragmatic enrichment. My study offers empirical observations and perspectives on the intersection of semantics and pragmatics in early language development, highlighting cross-linguistic patterns of pragmatic acquisition and the cognitive mechanisms that support them.

<h1> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Processing scalar implicature </span> </h1> 
In this project, I am exploring adults' processing of scalar implicature. My interest is to test whether implicature derivation is cognitively costly. I hypothesize that the processing effort required to compute scalar implicature is the same as the computation of logical meaning.

It is because both lower-bounded (logical) meaning and upper-bounded (implicature) meaning are not removed from context, and contextual information is not necessarily actively sought by the listener; rather it is given as the listener's cognitive environment. Please have a look at the following list to get an idea of the scope of the research.

<h1> <span style="color: #3498DB ;">Disjunction expressions in Indian languages: Usage of conditional morphemes </span> </h1>
This project aims to capture the nature of disjunction words used in the languages of the Indian sub-continent. Indian languages like Hindi or Bengali use more than one expression to refer to disjunction in sentences. 
<!--more-->
For example, Hindi uses '_yā_' and '_nahito_'; Bengali uses '_bā_ ' and '_noyto_' to refer to disjunction. Interestingly, words like '_nahito_' and '_noyto_' are bi-morphemic which can be split into an 'if not' construction. This phenomenon is not noticed in languages such as English, Japanese, Mandarin, or French for instance. Such bi-morphemic disjunction expressions are seen in other Indian languages too. Such as Meitei, a north-east Indian language, uses the word '_natraga_' or '_natradi_' to refer to disjunction which too have the 'if-not' meaning. For example, '_natra_' means 'not' and '_ga_' is a conditional bound morpheme. 

I aim to investigate why there is more than one expression for simple disjunction in these languages and how they are used - especially what significance the 'if-not' construction holds in these languages. My greater objective is to see how the information can feed/counter the existing theories about the human language faculty.
